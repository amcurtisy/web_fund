      <h2>Audrey M. Curtis</h2>
      <p style="font-size:18px;">Greetings, I am Audrey, a kind, giving, and loving person. I enjoy serving others with my gifts and talents of baking, cooking, and woodworking. 
        I enjoy teaching, sharing and uplifting those around me.<br>I love learning new things and applying them in my life. I have a wonderful
        and kind husband of 20 years, who keeps me grounded. We have three beautiful children who make me laugh because they know it is my favorite thing to do.<br>
        I have been a member of the church for 31 years, I joined when I was a teenager.</p> 
     <p style="font-size:18px;">I have just finished my associate's degree in Business Management with a Cyber Security Focus, Summa Cum Laude. Achieving that level was very important to me because 
        I work full-time, served in my local Union as a Vice-President over six states,<br>and still managed to care for my family and church callings. 
        My goal for school will be to do my best and obtain my bachelor's degree in Software Development despite the many physical challenges I am up against. 
        <br>I want my children to see my example of loving to learn, and hard work. I am excited to be in this class so far; it seems fun because it shows how I can build stuff. 
      </p>
